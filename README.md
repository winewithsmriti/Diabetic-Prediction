# Diabetic-Prediction
🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model that can accurately determine whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health parameters. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, the model is trained and evaluated using different algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The pipeline includes:

🔍 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing input features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding relationships and trends using visualization tools.

🧠 Model Training & Evaluation: Multiple models are trained, and their performance is compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

💾 Model Deployment: The best-performing model is saved using joblib and integrated into a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

🗄️ Database Integration: User input and prediction results are stored in an SQLite database for future analysis and tracking.

💡 Objective:
To create an easy-to-use, interactive web application that can assist individuals or healthcare providers in early detection of diabetes, thus enabling timely medical intervention.
